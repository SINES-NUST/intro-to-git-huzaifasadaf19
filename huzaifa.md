## Learning outcomes:writing_hand:

*The new concepts that I learned in this course are:
    -forks
    -Branches
    -Managing profile READme

## confusions:confused:
* I am confused about that whatever task is assigned to us on git was submitted to the instructor or not after we have done it.
* i cannot totally get the branches concept.
